# Agentic Experiences

## Agentic Experiences

A foundation of trust is necessary for humans to effectively use AI. To build and maintain trust, AI must produce trustworthy output, follow human rules, and stay in line with Salesforce’s ethical standards.

| **Do's** | **Don'ts** |
| :--- | :--- |
| AI responses and suggestions are neutral, inclusive, and free of bias | Don't generate AI content without providing clear feedback mechanisms |
| AI-generated actions are explainable and display sources where appropriate | Avoid AI-generated content that users can't edit or revise before it's applied to data |
| Always make AI disclaimers available to users | Don't let AI modify critical data without human validation |
| Execute AI actions with explicit user approval or control |   |

Understanding the language of agentic experiences helps readers understand the terms used in this guide. *This isn't a complete glossary of general AI terms.*

###An agent is an AI helper that can answer questions, automate tasks, and provide recommendations based on user input and context.

###Agentic refers to systems, interfaces, or experiences that give users a sense of autonomy, control, and active participation in achieving their goals through generative AI.

###An action is a predefined set of instructions that performs tasks in Salesforce. Actions take input parameters from the prompt input, execute a task, and then show outputs to display information or confirm that something has been executed.

##Standard actions are actions that Salesforce provides.

##Custom actions are actions customers create.

###A canvas is a space where users can create, organize, and customize content freely.

###The feed is the back-and-forth dialogue between a human and an AI that displays prompts and actions.

###Grounding is the use of specific data sources to provide context and support for AI responses, ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness.

###The prompt composer is the input where humans craft their prompt or query they send to the AI.

###Recommendations are suggestions provided by the agent, such as questions, next steps, or actions.

###Sources identify where the answer came from in the grounding data. Sources help to establish trust in the information provided by the agent.

###Topics represent the jobs you want AI to handle using a defined set of instructions and actions

To ensure seamless AI-driven interactions, follow these four key tenets.

###Agentic experiences are easy to use, with intuitive AI assistance that helps users navigate smoothly. As users become more comfortable, they can explore more advanced features. Don't overwhelm them by presenting those advanced controls up front.

###AI-generated content is clearly indicated so users can easily tell it apart from their own input. The agentic experience is transparent about its AI decisions, giving users simple explanations or citations for why it took action.

###AI makes work easier by offering smart recommendations and automating tasks to save time. The agentic experience reacts to users' input and anticipates what users need next, keeping workflows smooth and hassle-free.

###In some experiences, AI helps users without taking over their decisions. Users have the final say, with the ability to review and change AI suggestions before anything is applied. However, in agentic experiences, users set up rules for agents to enable them to make decisions for users only within the limits of the rules that users define.
