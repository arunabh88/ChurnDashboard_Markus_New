# Charts

## Charts

###| Charts tell the story of information. They make abstract data complete; give us an intuitive grasp of patterns; and help us identify trends, make comparisons, and track progress.  | **Start using our Design Kits**   |

########Comparison charts are used to show differences and similarities in data values. They include bar and column charts and dot plots.

###The bar chart is the workhorse of analytics. Because our eyes can quickly discern differences in height and length, it's a good choice for presenting simple nominal or ordinal data. The column chart is a common variant of a bar chart, used to compare ordinal values.

###Stacked bar charts are good for showing group relationships and value differences across more complex categories and subcategories. Stacked column charts can also be used to show group relationships within subsets of ordinal data.

| Do | |   | Do use a zero baseline to represent accurate data. |
| Don't | |   | Don't set the baseline to any number other than zero. Doing so misrepresents the data. |
| Do | |   | Do show ordinal data in ascending or descending order. |
| Don't | |   | Don't present data in nonlinear order. |
| Do | |   | Do use a single color to represent all values compared against the same measure. |
| Don't | |   | Don't add purely decorative shading or colors. |

###The dot plot uses circles to map values across x and y axes, then adds third or fourth measures in the form of dot size and color/intensity. It's a favorite of design guru Edward Tufte, due to its judicious use of ink and ability to convey complex information in a relatively uncluttered space.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use a dot plot to map smaller, sparser data sets with more than two variables. |
| Don't | |   | Don't use a dot plot with very large or extremely dense data sets—too many (or too-large) dots can make a dot plot hard to read. |

##Trending charts, such as line charts, are used to represent data that has changed over time.

###Line charts are good for representing changes in one or more values over time, especially trending data. Overlay multiple values (up to four) in one chart to help readers visualize the relationship between values.

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use a line chart to represent data with four or fewer related values. |
| Don't | |   | Don't choose a line chart for data sets with more than four values, or values of different measures. |
| Do | |   | Do compare values using similar units, on a consistent scale. |
| Don't | |   | Don't use this type of chart to compare values on vastly different scales. |

##Relationship charts, such as scatter plots, are used to show relationships and correlation between values in data.

###Scatter plots are useful for showing more complex data relationships, including correlation of multiple variables. For example, to illustrate correlation of revenue with number of open opportunities, plot the two measures on the x and y axis. As with the dot plot, dot size and color/intensity can convey additional information.

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do start at zero on the x and y axis. |
| Don't | |   | Don't show x and y axis data with starting points other than zero. |
| Do | |   | Do use color and size to highlight patterns and identify outliers. |
| Don't | |   | Don't represent outliers without identifying color variations. |

##Composition charts are used to show relative value, or represent relative makeup of a value, across a group. They include pie charts and treemaps.

###A pie chart maps relative value, or relative makeup of a value, across a data set. These charts highlight relative value (e.g., percentages) rather than absolute value.

*Pie Chart: Campaigns by Source*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use a pie chart to represent data with between two and five values. |
| Don't | |   | Don't choose a composition chart for data sets with more than five values, or values of different measures. |
| Do | |   | Do show data in descending order, starting at the 12 o'clock point and moving clockwise. |
| Don't | |   | Don't present data in nonlinear order. |

###A treemap shows the composition of hierarchical data using nested rectangles.

*Treemap: Profit Composition by Product*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do sort parent rectangles by size (most commonly with larger ones at the left and/or bottom of the chart). |
| Don't | |   | Don't arrange rectangles without regard to size, which can make data harder to evaluate. |

##Distribution charts are used to visualize volume distribution and spot outliers or anomalies. They include heatmaps and matrix charts.

###Heatmaps use color density to show concentration patterns for a single variable.

*Heatmap: Sales by Account and Product*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use color to represent data variations. |
| Don't | |   | Don't vary colors without reason. |

###Matrix charts use color density and bubble size to show concentration patterns for two variables.

*Matrix: Revenue and Sales by Account and Product*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use one color, or a gradient of that color, to represent the highs and lows of a continuous value. |
| Don't | |   | Don't vary colors without reason. |

##Metric charts show progress at a glance. They include flat and polar gauges and ratings charts.

###A flat gauge shows progress toward a specific metric. It's useful where space may be limited.

*Flat Gauge: Progress Toward Quota*

###A polar gauge also shows progress toward a specific metric, with the circle representing 100% of the goal.

Polar gauges can progress either by filling or draining, depending on the information conveyed.

*Polar Gauge: Progress Toward Quota*

###A ratings chart works much like a polar gauge, with the addition of comparison against a target quantity or expectation.

*Ratings Chart: Customer Satisfaction*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do add context with a reference point representing target or average value. |
| Don't | |   | Don't present data without a reference point. |
| Do | |   | Do use a flat gauge when space is limited. |
| Don't | |   | Don't address limited space with a too-small polar gauge. |

##Location charts show values using a geographical or coordinate map. Variations include bubble maps and geo maps.

###A standard location chart maps data values to a map or other geographical component. Areas of the map are shaded in proportion to related values, highlighting high- or low-value areas.

*Map: Sales by State*

###A bubble map functions much like a location chart. As in the dot plot, dot size and color/intensity can convey additional information about each plotted point.

*Bubble Map: Open Opportunities by State*

###Geo maps help readers visualize data that contains geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The coordinates allow more precise connection of data elements to locations.

*Geo Map: Sales, Profit, and Open Opportunities by State*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do choose maps showing regions reflected in your data. |
| Don't | |   | Don't include regions in your map that don't exist in your data. |
| Do | |   | Do use color and size to represent data variations. |
| Don't | |   | Don't add purely decorative shading or colors. |

##Pipeline charts show stages of a process, and the flow between those stages. They include funnel, waterfall, origami, and sankey charts.

###A funnel chart is used to represent stages in the sales or marketing process, with a value for each stage.

*Funnel Chart: Opportunity by Stage*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use a funnel chart to represent multiple stages in a process, with related values appearing in ascending or descending order. |
| Don't | |   | Don't use this chart type to show data without sequential stages. |

###A waterfall chart is used to show starting, intermediate, and final values for the stages of a process.

*Waterfall Chart: Pipeline Change by Stage*

| Rule | Image | Caption | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do | |   | Do use contrasting or meaningful colors to show differences in data. |
| Don't | |   | Don't add purely decorative shading or colors. |
| Do | |   | Do use a waterfall chart to show start and end points along with intermediate stages. |
| Don't | |   | Don't use this chart type to represent decomposition or roll-up of a number. |

###Origami charts display pop-out values in data with a single measure and grouping. You can also use them to show variability in stages whose values don’t decrease sequentially. They can work well to highlight values that are performing well relative to others in a category.

###Sankey charts show how values flow between two groupings, demonstrating how a given metric is distributed as it moves from one to another. A Sankey chart can display negative numbers and calculate their effect on overall totals.

###Color is important for data visualization. Colors help tell a story, guiding the user to view alerts or outliers and take desired actions.

##Color plays an integral part of narrating stories through a data visualization. Our team conducted [user research](https://www.fastcompany.com/90169654/two-fascinating-things-salesforce-discovered-when-it-studied-color) and came up with color themes that were accessible, easy to distinguish and had enough colors to show categories in data.

Users can select color themes from the Salesforce charting library. The default palette uses midtone hues from around the color wheel. All other themes have hues that are roughly 180 degrees from each other in the color wheel. Depending on hue chromaticity, certain hues have different RGB curves. Our accessible color-safe theme passes WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility.

| Do | |   | Do use one color to consistently define a single value. For example, if you use blue to represent sales win rate in one chart, use it to represent that value in all other charts. |
| Don't | |   | Do not use different colors to define the same value on a bar chart. For example, the win rate for should be the same color across all sales reps. |
| Do | |   | Do use same color to show same metric for different categories in a bar chart. |
| Don't | |   | Do not use different of colors to show the same metric on a bar chart. |
| Do | |   | Do use different colors to represent categorical data points in donut or tree-map. |
| Don't | |   | Do not use the shades of the same color on a donut or tree-map. |
| Do | |   | Do use one color, or a gradient of that color, to represent the highs and lows of a continuous value. |
| Don't | |   | Do not use multiple colors to show the highs and lows of a continuous value. |
| Do | |   | Do use a minimal color palette when associating colors with numbers. |
| Don't | |   | Do not too many colors when associating them with numbers. |

Research shows that most people's short-term memory can retain up to five pieces of information at one time, making five a good maximum for color choices.

*Use color as a metaphor when not working across multiple cultures. For example, in western cultures, it's common to use red to show bad and green to show good. Keep in mind, however, that colors can have different meanings in different cultures.*

Also keep accessibility in mind. When using color to distinguish chart elements, always use symbols or text as well. Use color-safe themes whenever possible.
