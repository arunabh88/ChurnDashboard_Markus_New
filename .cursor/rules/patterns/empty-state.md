# Empty State

## Empty State

###| Empty states are messages that appear whenever an element has no content to display to the user. They can appear anywhere in Salesforce, in both desktop and mobile interfaces. They can alert users to empty search results, unconfigured features, or, in some cases, errors. They can even appear to tell users that an empty area has been intentionally left blank.  *[See the Illustration component blueprint for implementation information](https://v1.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/illustration/)*  | **Start using our Design Kits**    |

*Empty state in a main content area*

######Each empty state must have a [message](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/2e1ef8501/v/0/p/21245c-empty-state/t/711047ae32). A [call to action](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/2e1ef8501/p/21245c-empty-state/t/b96393a77c) and [illustration](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/2e1ef8501/v/0/p/21245c-empty-state/t/889fcf5525) are optional.

#####An empty state message consists of two pieces:

* The **headline** offers an opportunity to convey more information while adding some fun.
* **Body text** adds details and engages users.

For readability, keep **line length** for each of these pieces under 66 characters per line. In general, try to keep the line length the width of your illustration. Please consider localization when writing copy that may cause wrapping to another line when localized.

########A CTA stands for call to action. It's a button that draws attention to the most logical action. A CTA helps users move from an empty state to a situation where the page, component, or element at hand is useful to them.

CTAs are optional, but helpful. They should be as specific as possible, answering the question *What should the user do next?*

########For empty states, illustrations are optional—but they’re a great way to add a touch of fun and visual interest while helping users understand their situation.
