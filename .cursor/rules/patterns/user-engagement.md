# User Engagement

## User Engagement

###| Throughout the Salesforce product ecosystem, we use engagement patterns to onboard, guide, assist, and educate users. These user engagement guidelines will help designers and their teams identify business goals and plan accordingly, put best practices to work, and leverage sample recipes for common scenarios. | **Start using our Design Kits**   |

###*Effective onboarding requires planning that involves storytelling, knowing your users, and experimenting.*

* **Identify the "aha moment."**The "aha moment" is when a user first realizes value in your product or solution. It usually happens first during onboarding, but can and should reoccur as the user grows and becomes increasingly proficient.
* **Address needs at all stages of the user journey.**Help maximize users' experience and efficiency. Are you designing for beginners, advanced users, or somewhere in between? New users need an onboarding flow that extends beyond the first five minutes after logging in. Existing users need flows for new features. Inactive users need flows that refamiliarize them with the product.
* **Fit the experience to the persona.**How do you want users to think or feel? What do you want them to do? Consider familiarity with the product and industry, motivation level, and product complexity. Then storyboard your flow before choosing how to deliver it. Explore the Salesforce user research personas and learn how to use them at your business on [Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/ux-personas-for-salesforce).
* **Experiment and optimize.**Choose a metric (for example, "trial to paid conversion" or "seven friends in ten days") that drives your users to the aha moment. What can you do to encourage this behavior? Use conversion research: What behaviors did long-lasting users display early on? What trends can you identify? Identity correlations between behavior and retention.

To help determine the right engagement experience for each user and situation, consider these factors:

**M.A.P. (message, audience, purpose)**Identify the **message**, **audience**, and **purpose** of your content. Write out what you want your target user to learn, understand, or achieve (for example, *I want users to get the lay of the land in Lightning Experience, and quickly understand how to do common tasks, so they can be productive.).* Are you onboarding admins to a new product that they must configure and roll out? Introducing established customers to a new product feature? Your answers will help you begin to design the user experience.

**Gauge complexity**How complex is your feature? How steep of a learning curve will new users have? Established users? Novice admins? How long before the user becomes proficient?

**Storyboard**Imagine a user’s first experience with your feature. What’s the most helpful information you can offer right away? On second or third run? Is your feature something the user can take action on, or is it more informational?

**Support, don’t disrupt**Is each in-app prompt both helpful and timely? Is it necessary? To avoid “pop-up-alooza,” check with others to make sure you're not creating competing or simultaneous content.

**Think beyond your channel**Work with your product owner and product marketing manager to plan a multichannel rollout. For example, pair an in-app onboarding journey with an email nurture campaign that build on each other.

**Keep it local**As much as possible, provide help, tips, guidance, and solutions in the UI itself, where users have the most context.

**Make it relevant**Personalize content to fit the user, organization, and other factors specific to the user experience (as in persona-based flows). Anticipate users’ needs using data (historical usage data, click paths, search terms, engagement metrics) and user research.

**Push or pull?**Do you need to push content to users that they wouldn’t otherwise notice, or will they be motivated to seek it out?

**Offer a secondary source**If appropriate, give users a way to reinvoke content pushed to them. Let users know where they can find tips and guidance in your app.

########| **Who**: User who is new to a trial, product, feature area, or release.  **What**: Getting-started content including setup guidance, feature or product value proposition, help topics, videos, walkthroughs, tips, rewards for learning.  **Why**: Show users where to begin, along with what’s available, new, or changed. Get them to the "aha moment" quickly. | Identify your aha moment and drive yours users to it quickly with guided onboarding.*Identify your aha moment and drive yours users to it quickly with guided onboarding.*  |
